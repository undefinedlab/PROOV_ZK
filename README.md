# Proove 📸

A mobile app for creating cryptographically verified photo proofs using zero-knowledge technology.

## What it does

Proove lets you take photos and generate cryptographic proofs that verify:
- **When** the photo was taken (timestamp)
- **Where** it was taken (location) 
- **What device** was used
- **Who** took it (identity verification)
- **What** the image contains

You can choose which information to reveal publicly while keeping the rest private.

## Features

- 📸 **Photo capture** with metadata extraction
- 🔒 **Privacy controls** - choose what to reveal
- 🛡️ **ZK Proof generation** - cryptographic verification
- 📱 **Mobile-first** - works on iOS and Android
- 🎯 **Simple interface** - essential privacy settings

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native, Expo
- **ZK Proofs**: Mopro (mobile zero-knowledge)
- **Storage**: Local device storage
- **UI**: Custom glassmorphic design

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the app: `npx expo start`
3. Use Expo Go app to scan QR code
